    "$$ \\rho_a = \\sum_{b} m_b \\cdot \\nabla W(r_a - r_b ; h)$$\n",
    "$a$ is my \"main\" particle, and $b$ is all my other particles. $m$ is my mass. $r$ refers to the position of the particle. $h$ refers to the smoothing length (currently set at 1 as default)  \n",

    "[$\\nabla W(r)$ uses the following equation](https://pmocz.github.io/manuscripts/pmocz_sph.pdf):  \n",

    "Where $d = 3$ because 3 dimension.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Upon calculation of $\\rho$, we can then [calculate pressure, $P$ using the following equation](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1985/1/012003/pdf):  \n",
    "$$P(\\rho) = P_0((\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0})^\\gamma)-1)$$  \n",
    "For fluids, $\\gamma = 7$ is often used. However, I have decided to $-0.5$ from this initial density. I will explain the rationale for this later on.  \n",

    "Wehre $B_a$ is the acceleration of particle $a$ due to external forces.  \n",
    "However, in the case of the dam break problem, there are no external forces, thus $B_a = 0 $  \n",
