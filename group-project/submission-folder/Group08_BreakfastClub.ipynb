    "## Project Aim\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to model fluid dynamics using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "[Fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics) is, broadly speaking, the study of how fluids flow. Fluid dynamics has a huge range of interesting applications, such as:\n",
    "1. [Biomedical Engineering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34476751/): the design of medical equipment such as vascular stents relies on a good understanding of how blood flows in the body.\n",
    "2. [Disaster Protection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-211-69356-8_1): tsunami forecasting and risk evaluation requires a good understanding of how the oceans move.\n",
    "3. [Industrial Design](https://www.dynamiq-eng.co.uk/pages/Fluid_mechanics_dynamics.php): building safe, efficient, and functioning equipment needs a good understanding of how \"fluids\" such as heat and pressure change over time.\n",
    "4. [Astrophysics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2219): somewhat surprisingly, we can model space as a fluid as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closer to home, fluid dynamics is also an active field of research in NUS.\n",

    "# Scientific Background\n",
    "## Fluids\n",
    "### Representing Fluids\n",
    "Fluids are typically represented as _continuous_ bodies of liquid that obey [certain assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics), namely:\n",
    "1. Conservation of mass - the amount of liquid in the system will not change.\n",
    "2. Conservation of energy - the amount of energy in the system will not change.\n",
    "3. Conservation of momentum - the total momentum in the system will not change.\n",
    "4. The continuum assumption - although our liquid is continuous, the properties of the liquid [\"may vary point-by-point.\"](http://pillars.che.pitt.edu/student/slide.cgi?course_id=10&slide_id=5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these are well-known physical laws, they are phrased as _assumptions_ in our model because we assume that the fluid of interest is an isolated system that does not interact with its surroundings. In real systems, this is obviously not the case, and the above laws will not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Studying Fluids\n",
    "Under these assumptions, we can model the various properties of the fluid and how they change over time using a set of mathematical equations. [NASA](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/nseqs.html) has provided a helpful graphic summarizing the equations used:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/nseqs.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- Solving partial differential equations (PDE) is very hard.\n",
    "- Solving _several_ PDEs at the same time is even harder (finding closed solutions is an [open problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier–Stokes_existence_and_smoothness), with a bounty of a million dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, engineers have been doing it successfully for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "**[Computational fluid dynamics](https://www.simscale.com/docs/simwiki/cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/what-is-cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/), or CFD for short, provides one solution to such modeling problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind CFD lies in high school calculus, and can be summarized as:\n",
    "1. Differentiating a function gives us the rate of change of the function.\n",
    "2. Partial differential equations are what happens when you do a lot of differentiation.\n",
    "3. We can approximate the derivative of a function numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put together, we can numerically approximate solutions to PDEs. In an ideal world, the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ is given by the equation $$f'(x)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ In our unideal world, we can set the value of $h$ to $0.005$ (an arbitrary number), and declare that to be the rate of change over time. In other words, we set our time step to $0.005$ seconds (or any other sufficiently small number that you like), and use this to approximate the complicated equations we see above. Informally, we say that we can approximate $f'(x)$ with the following: $$f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+0.005)-f(x)}{0.005}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts the problem from a calculus problem with differentiation and integration to a computational problem, involving millions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. To a computer, the latter is much simpler to perform than the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to introduce smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a computational method that translates the fancy equations to a much uglier, but simpler to compute version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)\n",
    "### SPH: The Basics\n",
    "The very first thing done in SPH is to take a closer look at the continuum assumption made above. Recall that the continuum assumption for a fluid says that properties such as density and pressure of the fluid may vary throughout the fluid. SPH takes that to an extreme - we can therefore model the fluid as a large collection of particles, each particle having its own properties such as density and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a very large collection of particles, we need to define the interactions between these particles. As Dan Price [writes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1259),\n",
    "\n",
    "> SPH starts with the answer to the question: \"How do I compute a density given a distribution of point-mass particles?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that density of an object is given by the mass of the object divided by its volume; in other words, we can think of density as how much \"stuff\" there is in a fixed part of space. In SPH, we assume that the mass of each of our particles is constant. Therefore, the only thing that can affect the density of a particle is the amount of space it occupies.\n",
    "\n",
    "How then, do we measure this amount of space? Here comes the tricky part! Intuitively, a particle cannot have a changing volume (think about it: do we expect the volume of a water molecule to change over time? No!). However, under the assumptions in SPH, **a particle is defined as a fixed amount of mass**. In other words, **particles do not represent individual molecules**. In reality, each SPH \"particle\" is a stand-in for something like 10,000 water molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Remark: the 10,000 figure given above is _wildly_ inaccurate. A mole of water has $\\sim 6\\times10^{23}$ water molecules, and if we represent only 10,000 water molecules with a particle, we will require _six quintillion_ SPH particles to simulate 18ml of water. It is likely that an SPH particle is a stand in for several morbillion particles, allowing us to model our fluid systems with a small enough number of particles that our computers will not explode.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the knowledge that each SPH particle is actually several morbillion water molecules, this allows us to introduce the notion of _density_ for an SPH particle. Several morbillion water molecules are obviously not a point mass, and will occupy a certain amount of space, hence giving us the density of the SPH particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPH: Practical Implementations\n",
    "Now that we've introduced the notion of SPH particles, what exactly can we do with them? The short answer is that we can use these SPH particles to model how the fluid changes over time. SPH allows us to derive the equations of motion for each SPH particle given the positions and density of other SPH particles, through the following equation: $$\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}=-\\sum_jm_j\\left(\\frac{P_i}{\\rho_i^2}+\\frac{P_j}{\\rho_j^2}\\right)\\nabla W(|\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j|,h),$$ where $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}$ is the acceleration of the $i$th particle, $m_j$ is the mass of the $j$th particle, $P_i$ and $P_j$ are the pressures acting on the $i$th and $j$th particles, $\\rho_i$ and $\\rho_j$ are the densities of the $i$th and $j$th particles, and $\\nabla W(|\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j|,h)$ is the derivative of a smoothing function, which we'll see more of in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a whole chunk of mathematics, but **the key takeaway is that we can compute the acceleration of an SPH particle through a lot of simple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication), without solving any differential equations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $W$, the Smoothing Function\n",
    "The smoothing function is a fancy mathematical way of saying that the particles which are closer to each other have a greater effect on each other. The [Gaussian Kernel](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung/teaching/MIA/reading/diffusion.gaussian.kernel.pdf.pdf) is a commonly used smoothing function that is shaped like a bell curve, with the height of the graph representing the effect of the particles surrounding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.imagemet.com/WebHelp6/Content/Images/Gauss3D.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the smoothing function is nothing but a fancy way of saying that particles close to each other have a greater effect on each other than particles which are far apart."

    "# Creating a Particle Simulation\n",
    "Our goal is to therefore model particles in Python. Prior to writing code, we need to carefully consider the requirements from our code. It is always good to start our design by considering the demands placed on it. We will need two things: particles, and a way for the particles to interact.\n",

    "One possible way of storing them is as a `numpy` array of floats.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Using classes\n",
    "Although the above code is perfectly functional, it is neither pretty nor extensible. If our particles are arrays of floats, it is tough for us to remember what exactly it is - is index 5 supposed to be the y-coordinate of the particle? Or is it referring to the density of the particle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to create new data types, known as _classes_, and define functions that allow us to interact between objects of this data type. We can therefore define a new `Particle` data type in Python, that allows us to interact with particles much easier. In the code below, we create a new data type called `ExampleParticle`, and show how to work with it. As we'll see shortly, when we define a new data type, we must also define the attributes that variables of that data type have, as well as some functions that define the ."

    "## Fluid Models: Dam Break\n",
    "The [dam break problem](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789813223882_0001) is a classic problem in fluid dynamics that simulates what happens when a dam is suddenly broken. In the dam break problem, a body of water is initially contained in an area, and the simulation starts when the walls containing the body of water are removed (the dam breaking). The dam break problem has been [written extensively on](https://pysph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/overview.html?highlight=dam%20break#the-dam-break-problem), and we therefore know what to expect from our model. We begin by building the necessary classes to support this model."

    "We begin building our SPH model by defining the `particle` and `particle_array` data types. Variables that are of a `particle` data type require many characteristics, such as a position and direction vector, density, and pressure. Our `particle_array` data type needs to be able to store an array of particles, and update their positions, accelerations, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Conditions\n",
    "Many of the initial conditions for our simulations can be found in the `__init__` functions in both the `particle` and `particle_array` class. These include values such as the initial velocity of the particles, or the initial positions of the particles in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "- The timestep of the simulation can be adjusted by changing the `dt` variable in the `__init__` function of the `particle` class.\n",
    "- The `update_sim()` function in the `particle_array` class will update the status of all particles in the simulation for the next timestep.\n",
    "- The `for` loop in the `__init__` function of the `particle_array` class determines the initial positions of the particles in the simulation.\n",
    "- The sources for the relevant physics equations are provided in the comments within the class.\n",
    "- The number of particles in the simulation and the boundaries of the simulation are not defined within the two classes."

    "- Highlight the importance of modeling fluid dynamics.\n",
    "- Demonstrate the ability of Python to model particle interactions.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how particle interactions can model fluid dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work is supported by [literature](https://pysph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#research-papers-using-pysph) and professionally developed solutions such as [PySPH](https://pysph.readthedocs.io), which comes with nearly 100 pre-built test cases to show the use of Python in modeling fluid dynamics. PySPH has been undergoing development for the [almost fifteen years now](https://pysph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#history), and is therefore far more optimized than anything we can write in one semester. Referring to the [rubrics](https://sps.nus.edu.sg/sp2273/assessment.html#rubric-for-presentation),\n",

    "> Suitable packages and functions are appropriately used without reinventing the wheel\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "Python is a powerful tool for exploring systems with no closed solutions. It allows us to use numerical methods to approximate the system, and perform large numbers of calculations to increase the accuracy and speed of our models."
